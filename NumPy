            1. Matrices
            2. Differentiations
                1. Partial Derivatives

Everything in Numpy deals with arrays -- numpy ndimensional arrays.

NumPy Data Type --- ndarray
Type Casting


Defining Numpy arrays with our custom values
    1. 0 Dimension     -- Scalar
    2. Point Dimension -- (1,1) --- 1 Dimension
    3. 1 - Dimension
    4. 2 - Dimension
    5. 3 - Dimension
    6. n - Dimension

Array is a continuous memory allocation of same type.

    --- float -- 8Bytes --- 8 * 8 = 64 bits --- float64 

                    ----------- float32
                    ----------- float16

    --- int ---- 4Bytes --- 4 * 8 = 32 bites --- int32

Scalar & Vector
    --- Scalars -- the data types which will be in memory default and always
    --- Vectors -- the data types which may benefit of cpu registers & graph execution.
