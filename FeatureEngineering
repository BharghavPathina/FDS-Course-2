    Data Analyisis:
        1. Graphical Analysis
        2. Statistics
            1. Attributes/Features/Columns/Variables
            2. Data Distribution
            3. Central Tendencies


CSV -- 
    1. Domain Knowledge
    2. Feature Importance 
    3. Attribute Selection 
        1. Numerical Attributes
        2. Categorical Attributes



Feature Module: -- Given an input CSV file we have to do feature engineering 


Features/Attribute/Columns/Variables:

1. NUmerical Attributes / Quatitative Attributes
2. Categorical Attributes / Qualitative Attributes  

1. Numerical Attributes -- COntinuous Attributes 
    Mostly important for Linear models
    Data Distribution ---
        Normal Distribution
        Skewed Distribution 
        Kurtosis Distribution

        --- Continuous Distributions -- Density Graphs
        1. Normal Distribution - Desirable
        2. Other 2 are undesirable --- Second Opinion 
            1. Decision -- ML Strategy
            2. At Source Data Generation Problem fix 

    Examples:   Age ---- (0-100) -- ratio-scaled Attribute
                Temperature ---- ()
        

2. Catrgorical Variables:
    Limited Range --- Range Categorical Threshold --- 100

    Unique values in a particular column > 100 then --- Numerical Attribute / Continuous Attribute


    1. Nominal Attribute -- Discard this --- #uniquevalues == number of rows - (1% of total number of rows)
    2. Ordinal Attribute 
    3. Binary Attribute -- ALl over there --- statistical forumalae


--- Is any column has same values
--- Is any column has zeros **********
--- In a particular column how many null values are there
