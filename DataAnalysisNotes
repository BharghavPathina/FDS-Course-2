Problem Statement:  For a given CSV dataset we need to Feature Engineering

Problem Approach:
        1. Input is CSV dataset 
            --- Large
            --- Raw dataset
            --- Lot of problems
                --- zeros values
                --- same values
                --- Date type issues
                --- Null values
                --- Lot of features 300-1000
                --- Duplicates

        2. Output
            --- Processed dataset
            --- May be features can be reduced
            --- Alerts ---- it costs more
            --- Data Sanitization
            --- Report

Python Modules:
        1. Pandas
        2. Numpy
        3. Matplotlib/seaborn

        5. ydata_profiling

Concepts:
        1. Statistics
