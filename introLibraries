Inroduction to Data Science Libraries:
    1. Numpy
    2. OpenCV -- CV2
    3. Pandas
    4. Tensorflow - Keras
    5. PyTorch
    6. MXNet
    7. Scikit Learn
    8. Caffe

Data Science (Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Deep Learning) --- for all of these problems
the solustion will be higher order mathematical problems

--- The solutions will be converted to graphical execution

    1. Example:
        a = 1
        b = 2
        c = a+b
        d = b+1
        e = c+d

    2. Parallilized execution
        --- Matheamtical Statements should be clustered into clusters
        --- For each cluster of statements we can have a graph notation
        --- 1. CPU Latency will be reduced
        --- 2. Graph Execution
        --- 3. GPU, FPGA, TPU


1. Numpy --- CPU only
2. Tensorflow, PyTorch, MxNet --- We can write programs in such a way that that can utilize the power of hardware.
3. Machine Learning Engines --- CUDA

    f(x) = m1x1+m2x2+......
