OOPs Conecpts:

    1. Class
    2. Object
    3. Properties
    4. Methods
    5. Abstraction
    6. Encasupation
    7. Inheritance
    8. Polymorphism


Inheritance: 
    1. Parent or Base
    2. Child

    Inheritance is the concept of inheriting the protected and public characteristics (Properties and Member Functions) from base (parent) class.

    Types of Inheritance:
        1. Single Inheritance
        2. Multiple Inheritance
        3. Multilevel Inheritance
        4. Hybrid Inheritance
        5. Hierarchial Inheritance

    protected properties and protected memeber methods are accessible in same package and to the classes of which the defined class was inherited.

1. Single Inheritance: inheriting characteristics from Single parent

2. Multiple Inheritance: inheriting characteristics from more than one parent

3. Multilevel Inheritance: Is a Single Inheritance with levels -- Associative Property

4. Hierarchial Inheritance: inheriting characteristics from Single parent to Multiple childs

5. Hybrid Inheritance: Tree of clases


Note:
    1. Protected Properties & Protected Member Functions will be accessed in a defined class and also in the classes of which defined class will be inherited.


--- Reusability
--- Heirachial Maintainance of code


Polymorphism: 
    having many shapes to the same functionality
