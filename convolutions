Convolutions

    Convolutional Valid Operation:

    ===> Input Image (Grey Image) ==> (w,h) -- Raw Input Image
    ===> Kernel or filter ===> Square matrix and the order of the matrix should be odd number
        

        Padding = 0
        Stride = 1
        Input Image size should be square matrix = (n,n)
        Kernel or filter size                    = (f,f)

        Then the output of the Convolution Operation = (n-f+1)


    Example: (6,6) & (3,3) ==> (6-3+1) ==> (4,4) (Shrinked)

        ---> Convolutional Oeration Advanatges ==> Reducsing number of features

        ==========================================>  


    Convolutional Same Operation:

        --> Padding (p) = 1
            Stride (s) = 1
        ---> Then the output of the Convolution Operation = (n-f+2p+1)

    Example: 6-3+2+1 = 6

    Strided Convolutional Operation:

        --> Stride (s) 

        ==> Then the output of the convolution operation = ((n-f+2p)/s +1)

        When we are doing strining operation the (n-f+2p) or (n-f) should be divisable by s

    Example: (7-3+2)/2 + 1 => (4,4)


Every Convolution operation on any image will produce a feature 2D array always


    Input Image Shape (Raw Image) = (w,h,3)

    Reshaped Image                = (n,n,3)

    filter Shape                  = (f,f,3)

    Number of filters             = k

    padding = 0
    stride = 1
    Then the output of the convolutional operation over volumes = ((n-f+1),(n-f+1),k)

    General formula                                             = (((n-f+2p)/s+1), ((n-f+2p)/s+1), k)




    What are filters/kernels?

    ===> Filter is a parameter W

    Y = MX + C


    Y = X * W + B ===> Convolutional Operation


        Operator Overloading



    Shapes of all tensors



            X = (n,n,3)

            W = (k,f,f,3) --> number of filters = k

            X * W = (n-f+1,n-f+1,k)

            B = Scalar number 

            Broadcasting B as to the shape (n-f+1,n-f+1,k)

            Vectorization

            Y shape = (n-f+1,n-f+1,k)


    Number of parameters for particulat operation

            Number of parameters = k*f*f*3 + 1
