Dimensions Notation for 1D: 
    -- Notations: (width,)
    -- height = 1

Dimensions: or Shape
    -- Notation: (Height * Width)
    -- Height = Number of rows
    -- Width = Number of cols

ndarray.shape -- property for ndarray

single Dimension --- memoery reference will be only one 
2 Dimension -------- memoery reference will be only one 
    1. Rows --- Each row will have reference

    -- initial reference = <address>
    -- int type of data in arrays
    -- shape of the array (3,2)
    -- give me the address of the 3 row 
        --- How the data is compressed
        --- by default the data will be quantized to normal -- int32
        --- second address of the second row  will be = <address> + 8Bytes
        --- third row address will be = <second row address> + 8Bytes
        ---                             <addres> + 8Bytes +8Bytes       
                                        <address> + 2 * 8 8Bytes    
                                        <address> + row_index * width * size of the quantized data type
                                        


If depth = 3:
    then (Height,width,3) -- 3D

    
Colors --- RGB
        3D  
        Colors = (R,G,B)


        Color_Image == height * width * 3
        Resolution = (Height,Width)

            
Dimensions - Notation for 3D

        Height * width * depth
        depth == Number of channels
        channel == (height,width)

        (height, width, 2) its not 2D
        (height, width, depth)

        Units will be applied to Height, width



Dimensions - Notation for ND:

        Number of 3Ds * Height * width * depth

        10 * 2 * 2 * 10
