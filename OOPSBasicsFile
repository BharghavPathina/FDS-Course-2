rs. ---- When you are accessing instance properties inside the class using self, you can access all properties irrespective of access specifiers
                -- outside the class only public instance properties will be accessed through object.

        3. Member Point --- memory management
                -- (->)
                -- (.)


Class Constructors:
        1. def __init__(self,a,b,c):
        2. constructors will be called at the time of creation of an object
                object_name = class_name() --- default constructor will be called if there is no constructor defined
        3. Default constructor contains nothing --- object has no instance properties but it can have class properties and access permission for member methods.
Object State:
        --- When we are creating an object it has all class properties, instance proprties and member methods.

        --- object state will be determined by the values of the properties



Class Methods, Instance Methods

        1. class methods --- are common methods of a class
                         --- @classmethod
