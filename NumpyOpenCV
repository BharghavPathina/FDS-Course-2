Hardware details & importance of hardware w.r.t Data science
Numpy:
    1. Parallel Execution
    2. Arrays
        1. scalar
        2. vector
        3. 0 dimensions
        4. 1 dimensions
        5. 2 dimensions
        6. 3 dimensions
        7. n dimensions
    3. Represenation / Visualization of Arrays
    4. 3D Array Slicing
    5. Basic Numpy Functions
    6. Explicit Type Cast to ndarray
    
*** You have to visualize atleast 3D array
*** You have to very aquaitance with writing dimensions for given array
*** you should confirm that Numpy follows Vectorization & Broadcasting


OpenCV:
    1. GPU
    2. OpenCV Array -- Numpy Arrays
    3. Colored Image
        1. channels -- R,G,B
    4. Preprocessing
        1. Image Reading Format
        2. Image Color COnvertions & importance
        3. Normalization -- Scaling --- [0-1]
    5. PostProcessing
        1. Color Extraction -- extcolors
        --- Assignment -- extracting distinct colors from an image.
        2. Contours for only one color --- Array of points
        3. How to draw border
    6. uint8
